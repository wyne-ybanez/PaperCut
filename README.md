## User Experience Design

### **The Strategy Plane**

- The user doesn't know what book they would like to read. Perhaps they know the genre they might like to read but 
they woudln't know exactly where to start. Alternatively, they might have just read a fantastic book and would like 
to share their opinions. Papercut is the site that will allow them to engage with other readers and 
share their personal reviews. 

- This website aims to allow the reader to quickly find book recommendations and create reviews on books they have 
read, reviews which can be seen by other users to help them make a decision on whether to read/purchase a certain 
book. All reviews are recorded and can be editted or deleted by their respective authors. The users can also add user statuses of which other user's can read.

#### Site Goals

- To bring together like-minded readers and allow them to express their views on a novel they enjoy or dislike.
- To help readers make a decision on what book they should read next.
- To allow readers to connect with other readers through their individual profiles.

#### User stories

- As a user, I immediately want to know the purpose as to why the site was made.
- As a user, I would like if the website were easy to navigate and that I never felt lost no matter where I was 
when exploring the website
- As a user, I want the website to be responsive, if I were to view it on mobile, tablet, laptop or desktop. I expect
its content to be clear and be positioned accordingly.
- As a user, I want to be able to return to the main site without having to use the browser buttons so 
that I can easily return to the website if I navigate to a page that doesn't exist.
- As a user, I want to be able to register an account to the website so I can post book reviews. I also want to
be able to edit and delete the reviews I created.
- As a user, I want to be able to edit and delete the profile I created.
- As a user, I want to be able to see the posts I created and the posts other users have created.
- As a user, I want to be able to search/filter book reviews on a custom genre or criteria as best suits me.

#### Admin

- As an admin I want all of the above options but I want to also be able to access and delete the reviews 
made by other users.
- As an admin I want a dashboard to which displays the available functionalities for my website.
- As an admin I want to be able to create and delete review categories/genres.
- As an admin I want to be able to view how many users are registered on the website and delete users if 
necessary.

#### Database Design (MongoDb)

Sample Object Format:

**Collection: genres**<br>

{<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_id: <em>unique value</em>,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;genre_name: "Adventure"<br>
}

**Collection: posts**<br>

{<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_id: <em>unique value</em>,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;genre_id: <em>(genre)unique value</em>,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;post_title: "The best new Thriller",<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;book: "Sixteen Horses by Greg Buchanan",<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;review: "Near the dying English seaside town of Ilmarsh, local police detective...",<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;date: "28 April, 2021",<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;created_by: <em>unique username</em><br>
}

**Collection: users**<br>

{<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_id: <em>unique value</em>,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;username: <em>unique username</em>,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;password: <em>unique hashed password</em>,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;avatar: "https://gravatar.com/avatar/dfd40517948bc137cfff2c6de1db27cc?s=400&d=r...",<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;status: "Im doing fantastic!",<br>
}

#### Database Security

Database security is maintained through the "env.py" file which ensures that the configuration files are not stored in github via .gitignore. For production, the configuration details are placed into the app settings within Heroku.

### **The Surface Plane**
### Design

#### Colour Scheme

The main website color is orange:<br>
![orange_color](readme_Img/orange.png)

Text colors derive from materialize css white-text, black-text and saddle brown. These colors were used interchangeably depending on the background color used: 
<br>
![black_and_white](readme_Img/black&white.png)
<br>
![brown-color](readme_Img/main-brown.png)

The base color is the 'old lace' and wheat, variations of white color:<br>
![base_color](readme_Img/old-lace.png)
<br>
![wheat_color](readme_Img/wheat.png)

#### Typography

The main typography used for the website was the font named "Benne". This font was accessed through Google fonts. 

#### Imagery

All images used within the website were all taken from [unsplash](https://unsplash.com/).

## Differences to Wireframes

- The main homepage/main page was part of the original design, however, I thought it would be best if users could visit the website and get straight into reading posts regardless if they had an account or not. This would allow for newcomers to discern and explore what the website was about.

- The registration page originally two input fields for the password and a second one to confirm the original password. This is something I seek to implement in the future.

- Originally, it was desired that the user could update their profile images with their preferred pictures. At the moment the website creates a drop down list of which the user can choose an avatar for their profile. User image uploads is a feature I would like to implement into this website in the future.

- The option to change the user's email address on the profile has been removed. Instead the user can only edit their profile status and posts. I did this to avoid confusion between user's, in order to make finding author's posts easier and maintain account security.

- The Admin Dashboard has been altered immensely. Every user now has the search feature available at the top navigation bar. Instead, the dashboard will display the number of posts and the number of users registered on the website. It will also allow the admin to edit or delete genres as he/she pleases.

****
## Features

### Existing Features

- Home page which displays the most recent 25 posts within the community and portrays the website's purpose.
- Registration feature which allows users to sign up and create an account.
- Log in Feature which allows users to sign into their account.
- Search functionality which is on every page in the website as long as the user is signed in.
- Genre search functionality which allows users to search for posts based on the post genre.
- Profile page which shows logged in user's username, status and posts. Displays other profile's usernames and status.
- Posts modification - the website allows content creators to create, edit or delete profiles and posts they have created.
- Mobile responsiveness.
- Side Navigation bar which can be toggled on and off through the hamburger menu.
- Admin dashboard which allows the admin to view website statistics and manipulate genres.

### Features Left to Implement

A feature I would like to implement in the near future is to allow users to upload their own profile pictures.

Another feature I would like to add is on the registration page. An authenticator which confirms the user's desired password via a second input field which reads if both passwords match.

A feature I would like to work on in the future is the ability to like another user's post, perhaps sort reviews according to the most liked post.

## Testing

### Test Strategy
#### **Summary**
Testing is to be made to ensure all features of the website is working as intended and that the links lead to the appropriate pages. Tests must be made to judge the websites responsiveness. Additionally, that all inputs done through the forms will submit the data to the appropriate collections. It is also there to ensure the project's code structure abides the universal best practices for programming. 

HTML Code must pass through the [W3C HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_uri).

CSS Code must pass through the [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/).

JavaScript code must pass through the [JSHint Validator](https://jshint.com/).

Python Code must pass through [PEP8 Validator](http://pep8online.com/)

### Test Results

Test Results are documented [here](TESTING.md)

## Deployment

### Project Creation

- Project started using Github and Gitpod.

1. First I signed into Github and created a new repository. There will be a drop down menu when looking to use a template
    so I chose to use Code Institute's Template. Alternatively, you can navigate [here](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/gitpod-full-template)
    and there will be an option button called "Use this template".

2. I then clicked the use this template button. Where I was directed to create a new repository name and create a new 
    repository which I could open using Gitpod.

3. It creates a Gitpod workspace of which I could start developing the project.

### Local Deployment

To deploy the project locally, the following commands were used:

1. In the terminal, type "pip3 install Flask" which sets up flask and allows imports.

2. In terminal, the developer then types in "touch app.py" or create a new file and name it "app.py". This is where the applications funcationality derives from.

3. We will be storing some sensitive information for local deployment, hence an "env.py" file must be created.

4. Open a ".gitignore" file and type "env.py" as well as "__pycache__/" in this .gitignore file.

5. Type "import os" within the "env.py" file in order to set default envrionment variables.

- The IP variable is set to "0.0.0.0" - (os.environ.setdefault("IP", "0.0.0.0"))
- The PORT is set to "5000" - os.environ.setdefault("PORT", "5000")
- SECRET_KEY is set to the developers own generated secret key - os.environ.setdefault("SECRET_KEY", "#SECRET_KEY")
- MongoDB name is set to the database name created by the developer - os.environ.setdefault("MONGO_DBNAME", "#DbName")
- Mongo URI is provided by MongoDB upon creation of a Database and is used for Database connection - os.environ.setdefault("MONGO_URI", "#ProvidedMongoURI")

### Version Control 

In the terminal, I utilised the following commands in the following order:

- git add . (git add <em>filename</em>) - command to add all files or a specific file 
- git commit -m <em>commit message</em> - command to commit the changes locally with a message to describe the changes briefly
- git push - command to push changes to remote Github repository

### Deployment to Heroku
**Create application:**

1. I signed into Heroku 
2. I created a new app by clicking the "new" button.
3. Select the new app 
4. Create an app project name 
5. Selected Europe as the region

**Set up connection to Github Repository:**

1. A requirements.txt needs to be created, this can be done through the following terminal command
    >  pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt

2. Then a Procfile for Heroku is needs to be created, here is the terminal command used
    >  echo web: python app.py > Procfile

3. Ensure there the Procfile begins with a capital letter 'P' and that there are no unecessary spaces 

4. Click the deploy tab and select Github - connect to Github

5. There will be an empty input field where you can type the name of your repository. Write the repo name there and 
    click search

6. Once the repository has been found, click the connect button

**Set environment variables:**

- Click the settings button at the top of the page
- There will be an option titled 'Reveal Config Vars' - click on this 
- Here, you can add your config variable keys from your `env.py` file

<strong>Example:</strong>

- key: IP, value: 0.0.0.0
- key: PORT, value: 5000
- key: MONGO_DBNAME, value: (<em>Database name you wish to connect to</em>)
- key: MONGO_URI, value: (<em>Mongo URI - This can be found in MongoDB by going to clusters > connect > connect to your application and substituting the password and dbname that you set up in the link</em>).
- key: SECRET_KEY, value: (<em>Custom Secret Key</em>).

**Enable Automatic Deployment & Manual Deployment:**

- Ensure your Procfile and requirements.txt are in your repository as Heroku will not be able to deploy without these
- Click the Deploy tab
- Click Enable Automatic deploys in 'Automatic Deploys' section
- Choose the branch you would like to deploy and click "Deploy Branch"

### Local Clone

**Note: To run this project locally, an "env.py" file must be created for configuring IP, PORT, MONGO_URI, MONGO_DBNAME and SECRET_KEY. These details are private and not disclosed in this repository for security purposes.**

This is used when you would like to make changes to the project code

1. Should you wish to use a different IDE like VSCode. You first log in to Github and locate the required repository. Here is the link for this [repository](https://github.com/wyne-ybanez/PaperCut)
2. Open a new terminal on Git Bash
3. Type `git clone`, and then paste the URL you copied 

```
$ git clone https://github.com/wyne-ybanez/PaperCut
```

 Here is a link that can explain this process further. [Click Here](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository#cloning-a-repository-to-github-desktop)

### Fork Project 

You can fork the repository through the following steps. Forking the repository means you will have a copy of the repository and any changes you make will not affect the original repository.

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the GitHub Repository. Here is a link for the [repository](https://github.com/wyne-ybanez/PaperCut)
2. At the top of the Repository (not top of page) just above the "Settings" Button on the menu. Looking towards the right of the page. Locate the button "Fork" then click 
3. You should now have a copy of the original repository in your GitHub account
